# Awesomespace

One of my first projects on Android, where I learned how to create simple UI, basic network operations, simple json responce parsing and basic usage of LiveData and ViewModel.

Uses com.github.chrisbanes.photoview for zoom functionality.
Uses public API https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html to show Astronomy picture of the day image in app.
